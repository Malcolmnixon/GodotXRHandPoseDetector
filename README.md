This repository contains a hand pose detector for Godot that detects poses on XRHandTracker sources.

## Versions

Official releases are tagged and can be found [here](https://github.com/Malcolmnixon/GodotXRAxisStudioTracker/releases).

The following branches are in active development:
|  Branch   |  Description                  |  Godot version   |
|-----------|-------------------------------|------------------|
|  master   | Current development branch    |  Godot 4.3-beta1+ |

## Overview

Godot [XRHandTracker](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_xrhandtracker.html) data is generated by some XR systems such as OpenXR. This project contains assets capable of detecting standard and user-defined hand poses and firing signals when the user poses their hands in those configurations.

## Usage

The following steps show how to add the Godot XR Hand Pose Detector to a project.

### XR Hand Tracking Project

Ensure the existing project is configured with XR hand tracking. The demo project and main scene shows how to do this for OpenXR.

### Install Addon

The addon files need to be copied to the `/addons/hand_pose_detector` folder of the Godot project.

### Add Hand Pose Detectors

Add Hand Pose Detector nodes into the scene - one for each hand.
![Add Hand Pose Detectors](/docs/add_hand_pose_detectors.png)

Configure the hand pose detectors with the pose-set to detect, and the hand tracker to monitor.

Connect the hand pose detector signals as desired

## Custom Hand Poses

New hand poses can be made by creating new Hand Pose Resource instances.
![Hand Pose Resource](/docs/hand_pose_resource.png)

Hand Pose Resources consist of:
* A Pose Name (reported in the pose detector signals)
* A Threshold (a minimal fitness threshold to report the pose)
* An array of Hand Pose Rules

### Hand Pose Rules

![Hand Pose Rule](/docs/hand_pose_rule.png)

Hand Pose Rules consist of:
* A Rule Name (useful for tuning and debugging)
* A Rule Type [Flexion, Curl, Abduciton, and Tip-Distance]
* A Finger
* A second Finger (for Abduction and Tip-Distance)
* Fitness Function Terms (min, lower, upper, max)

### Rule Types

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| Flexion | The angle (in degrees) of a fingers proximal joint curving into the palm to make a fist. |
| Curl | The curl (in degrees) of a finger from the proximal to the distal joints. |
| Abduction | The spread (in degrees) between two selected fingers. |
| Tip Distance | The distance (in millimeters) between the tips of two selected fingers. |

### Fitness Function

Each rule produces a measurement in either degrees or millimeters. This measurement is translated to a fitness value in the range 0..1 using a transform defined by the fitness function terms. Values outside of the min/max range have a fitness of 0. Values inside the lower/upper range have a fitness of 1, and min-lower and upper-max are connected by a smoothstep function:
![Fitness Transform](/docs/fitness-transform.png)

The fitness of a Hand Pose is the product of the fitness of all the rules.

## Designing and Tuning

The inspect scene provided in the demo project can be used to inspect the flexion, curl, abduction, and tip-distance of a hand, and can also inspect a selected hand pose to diagnose the fitness of the rules.
